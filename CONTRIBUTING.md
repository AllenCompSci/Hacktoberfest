## How Can I Contribute?

Try to keep things as modular as possible, the new file/directory structure should be: 
```
/topic/sub_topic/specific/language/file(s)
```
I would prefer different languages in different files, under same topic

# Our repos are chatty!

SendGrid works closely with our community to find solutions and build new features. These communications can lead to a lot of notification emails and this month will be no exception.

If you would like to avoid the Github notifications and updates that come from watching a repo, please sign up to receive only release notes through the library-specific newsletter of your choice. You will be sent release notifications, rather than every single comment, issue, and PR that happens!
