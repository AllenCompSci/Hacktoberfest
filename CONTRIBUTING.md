## How Can I Contribute?

Try to keep things as modular as possible, the new file/directory structure should be: 
```
/topic/sub_topic/specific/language/file(s)
```
I would prefer different languages in different files, under same topic

reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check if the bug was already reported before as you might find out that you don't 
need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. 
If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Thank you and happy hacking!

# Our repos are chatty!

SendGrid works closely with our community to find solutions and build new features. These communications can lead to a lot of notification emails and this month will be no exception.

If you would like to avoid the Github notifications and updates that come from watching a repo, please sign up to receive only release notes through the library-specific newsletter of your choice. You will be sent release notifications, rather than every single comment, issue, and PR that happens!
